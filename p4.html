<h1>US History</h1>

<p>If I'm being honest, I don't like history. Listening about what people did over 200 years ago in the hear ye hear ye times just doesn't spark my interest, I'm in the class because I apparently failed in sophomore year. Right now we're talking about what the United States did after the civil war and what they were to do with all of the recently freed slaves. I don't care much for these periods as nothing exciting happens like, lets say, WWII where science was taking over in warfare with planes, tanks, the guns they used, and everything in between, in the 1800's they had cannons and muskets and fought in lines. That kind of history is just not for me.</p>
