    <h1>Computer tech</h1>

    <p>Computer tech has been one of the classes I've wanted to take since freshman year, but I never was able to get in until this year. So far it's been pretty interesting, we already took apart and rebuilt computers and we're going to work on loading an OS onto the hard drive, that OS being Windows 10.</p>

    <h3>The class goes from: <br> 9:18-10:06</h3>
    <h3>The class is in room: <br> 197</h3>
