<title>Algebra II</title>
    <h1>Algebra</h1>

    <p>For period 1 I have Algebra II with Mr. Mealy, I'm taking this because I had a lot of trouble trying to learn how to do math while at home with a lot of distractions. Algebra is not so easy to learn when you just play Minecraft throughout the class while the teacher wants you to do whatever work you're supposed to be doing. We are working with systems of equatoins right now and it honestly isn't as hard as I remember it being and it can be kind of fun/rewarding to find correct answers.</p>
<h3>The class goes from: <br>7:30-8:18</h3>

<h3>The class is in room: <br>175</h3>
