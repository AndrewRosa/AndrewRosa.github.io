    <h1>Game and web design</h1>

    <p>Game and web design has got to be my favorite class so far, I've always learned best when I can create something and see what I made in front of me. In the class so far we have created a few websites, 1 was a basic site, then we made a more advanced site with links and pictures, then we did a project using everything we learned from the first two, and now we're making a website on our schedules for this semester.</p>
