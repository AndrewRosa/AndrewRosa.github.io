    <p>Next up, world literature. This class is with Ms. Puchalski-Piretti and I'm taking it because I have to for credit but I also want to learn more about new authors and hope that I can find one that I actually enjoy, also, we get to choose a film/tv seires made outside of the United States to watch for a grade in class which is pretty cool.</p>
    <h3>The class goes from:<br> 8:22-9:14</h3>
    <h3>The class is in room:<br>271</h3>
